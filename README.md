Data Preprocessing: It includes importing necessary libraries, reading a CSV file named 'malware.csv', encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

SVM Model Creation and Evaluation: I created a SVM model using sklearn.svm.SVC with specified parameters. It also includes splitting the dataset into training and test sets, fitting the model on the training data, and making predictions.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. Both hold-out and N-fold cross-validation methods are used for evaluation.
